								</div>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Also known as Beucarnea is so called, as you can see, by the shape of its trunk, wider at the base and rough like the skin of the pachyderm.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">With hardly any light and without irrigation it grows perfectly. Beaucarnea abhors excess water and should be planted in a pot with a hole in the bottom along with a bed of gravel or clay beads at the bottom of the pot for better drainage, although it is not a very demanding plant in terms of substrates.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It loves to be tightly packed and should never be planted in a pot that is too wide, it could even grow under a ladder and is very economically priced.</p>

								<h2 class="plant-title strelitzia">STRELITZIA</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">If you are looking for an exotic, large and easy to care for plant for your home, what you need is a <span class="underline-text">Strelitzia, the fashionable plant in decoration</span>. The prerequisite is that you place it in the area with more natural light, and it will withstand indoor temperatures perfectly.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It needs little watering, but make sure the soil is completely dry before watering it again. Of course, if your house does not have high ceilings, you may have to find a new home for it in a few years, because it can grow up to 6 meters.</p>

								<h2 class="plant-title aloe-vera">ALOE VERA</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Besides being one of the most used plants for decoration, aloe vera is also useful (cutting a leaf every time you finish/need it) to treat scars and skin imperfections.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It needs natural light but without exposing it directly to the sun. It is also very sensitive to humidity so it needs water only when the soil is completely dry. Regarding temperature, it is sensitive to cold, but the average temperature of a house is perfect for its care.</p>
							</div>

								<h2 class="plant-title cactus">CACTUS</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text"><span class="underline-bold-text"><strong>The cactus is the survivor par excellence</strong></span>. It is very rare that a cactus dies at the first change so, if you do not want to complicate your existence too much, this is the ideal plant for the interior of the house, which withstands the cold as well as the heat and needs little maintenance.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Its unusual textures <strong>create the visual appearance of sculptures</strong> and, the best thing is that there are an infinite number of types to choose from.</p>

							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title palm-tree">PALM TREE</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">The lounge palm or <em>Chamaedorea Elegans</em> is a palm tree cultivated as a houseplant. It is a very resistant plant, so it withstands both shadows and bright spaces although, as with most of them, you should take care that it does not get direct sunlight.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It is advisable that it has a good environmental humidity, so get a water diffuser and water very occasionally (when you see that the tips of the leaves dry out). It does not tolerate low temperatures of less than 7-8ยบ degrees and if it has little light, it will grow slower, which would be a pity, because in optimal conditions it can reach a meter in height.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="plant-container reverse">

								<h2 class="plant-title poto">POTO</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text"><span class="underline-text">The poto is a plant is very easy</span> for inexperienced hands in the matter besides being very showy. They need a lot of light but it is best that it is not direct, so leave it near a window.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">As for watering, you can give it water every 4-5 days allowing the first layer of substrate to dry before watering again. By the way, do not overdo it with the heating and try to keep the temperature around 20ยบ.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="plant-container">
							<img src="fern.jpg" class="left-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title fern">FERN</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Ferns have a reputation for being difficult plants. But like everything else, there is a part legend and a part truth. Once you learn how to care for them, you will realize that the fern is not only easy to care for, but it is also a very hardy plant.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It likes light, but don't expose it to direct sunlight (preferably a shady corner). It likes a lot of water and, above all, humidity, but without excesses, so be careful with the heating that can make its dense foliage turn brown, dry out, and lose its leaves in record time.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="plant-container reverse">
							<img src="calathea.jpg" class="right-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title poto">CALATHEA LANCIFOLIA</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It is also a plant that originally grows in an environment with little natural light and does not require frequent watering so we can say that you <strong>do not have to worry much about it</strong> to keep it healthy and safe.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It is <strong>perfect for small spaces</strong> because its growth rate is very slow and there is no danger of it eventually taking over half the room. It is striking for its <strong>intense maroon color on the back of the leaves.</strong></p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="plant-container">
							<img src="ficus.jpg" class="left-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title ficus">FICUS</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">The ficus is very showy and easy to care for, although you will have to clean the leaves from dust as they are so smooth. It is a plant that should not receive direct light during the summer, but it does need to be in a room with natural light. In addition, the root ball (the soil surrounding the root) should never be allowed to become dehydrated. The ideal temperature? In an environment of 20ยบ it will develop correctly. Perfect for <strong>a Japandi style house.</strong></p>

						<div class="plant-container">
							<img src="tricolor maranta.jpg" class="left-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title tricolor-maranta">TRICOLOR MARANTA</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Originally this plant grows in shady places in the forest so it will have no problem in staying healthy inside your home.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">It is widely used in decoration because of the characteristic color of its leaves that, depending on the changing season, they acquire one shade or another on the scale of green.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Although its leaves eventually reach large dimensions, it is not a species that grows excessively in height so it is perfect to place on a piece of furniture or shelf.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="plant-container reverse">
							<img src="vriesea.jpg" class="right-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title vriesea">VRIESEA</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Also called Indian Feather, it is an indoor plant of the bromeliad type. As it is a tropical plant, you should try to keep it in humid environments. The ideal? That you put it together in a group with other tropical plants so that they generate humidity between them.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">Although it does not reach a height of more than 30-50 cm, its spectacular flower does not need much to be seen (and admired). Be careful with watering: watering it a lot does not mean that its leaves will be greener and its flower will last longer. It is best to choose a pot with a hole in the bottom and remove excess water. With a draining substrate or a layer of gravel or clay pebbles at the bottom of the pot, water will flow more easily.</p>

						<div class="plant-container">
							<img src="brezo.jpg" class="left-plant-image">
							<div class="plant-details">
								<h2 class="plant-title brezo">BREZO</h2>
								<p class="plant-description-text">This dwarf shrub resists perfectly the cold although it loses its color at this time and turns green. It can withstand temperatures down to -25 degrees, so you can place it without fear on your balcony or terrace.</p>
								<p class="plant-description-text">In February it will bloom in colors like pink and white and will be perfect if we create a composition of different pots.</p>

						<h2>Care tips for indoor plants</h2>
						<p class="content-text">Although each indoor plant has its own specific needs, there are some basic cares that apply to most of them:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Light: Most indoor plants need indirect light. Place them near a window but avoid the sun directly.</li>
							<li>Water: Be sure to water them regularly, but not excessively. Most indoor plants need a weekly irrigation, but check the specific needs of each plant.</li>
							<li>Substrate: Make sure that the substrate in which your plant is planted has good drainage capacity. If water accumulates on the surface, it is likely to be retaining too much moisture.</li>
							<li>Fertilizer: If you want your plants to grow healthy and strong, you can use fertilizer once a month. There are different types of fertilizer according to the needs of each plant.</li>
							<li>Cleaning: Clean the leaves of your plants regularly to avoid the accumulation of dust and facilitate the absorption of light.</li>
